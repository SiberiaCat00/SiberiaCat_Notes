## Definition: Preorder
$(S,\leq)$ is a preordered set $\Leftrightarrow$ $S$ is a set and $\leq$ is a relation which satisfy:
$$\forall a,b,c\in S:a\leq a\text{ and }a\leq b, b\leq c \Rightarrow a \leq c$$That means $\leq$ is reflexive and transitive.

## Definition: Directed set
$(S,\leq)$ is a directed set $\Leftrightarrow$ $(S,\leq)$ is a preordered set and $$\forall a,b\in S,\exists c: a\leq c,b\leq c$$That means every finite subset of $S$ have a superior.
