# Qualitative determination of $\ce{K,Fe^3+,C2O^-4}$.
## $\ce {K+}$
Use flame test. $\ce {K+}$ will show purple.
## $\ce{Fe^3+}$
Add test solution into $\ce{SCN-}$. $\ce{Fe^3+}$ will show blood-red solution.
## $\ce{C2O^-4}$
Add test solution into $\ce{CaCl2}$. $\ce{HCOO-}$ will produces precipitation.
# Quantitative determination of $\ce{Fe^3+,C2O^-4}$
## $\ce{Fe^3+}$
Use $\ce {Zn}$ powder to convert $\ce{Fe^3+}$ into $Fe^2+$. Hence we can use oxidation titration measurements by $\ce{KMnO4}$.
## $\ce{C2O^-4}$
$\ce{C2O^-4}$ can be quantitatively oxidized in acidic media by $\ce{KMnO4}$. Hence we can use oxidation titration measurements.
